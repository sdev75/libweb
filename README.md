# LIBWEB Framework library

This is a basic PHP framework library built with performance in mind.

Some functionality require refactoring of code, therefore it's a work in progress.

The code has been made public to ensure transparency and ease of maintenance.

The code is simplified to favor easy maintenance. Further improvements will be added to this repository.
